        Set in the fictional Pacific Northwest town of Twin Peaks, the series
        follows an investigation led by FBI special agent Dale Cooper (Kyle
        MacLachlan) into the murder of local teenager Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee).
        The show's narrative draws on the characteristics of detective fiction,
        but its uncanny tone, supernatural elements, and campy, melodramatic
        portrayal of eccentric characters also draw from American horror and
        soap opera tropes. Like much of Lynch's work, it is distinguished by
        surrealism, distinctive cinematography, and offbeat humor. The musical
        score was composed by Angelo Badalamenti with Lynch.
